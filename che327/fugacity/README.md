Finding fugacity of a real gas by using experimental data. 

Since all gases are not ideal there would be a deviation from ideal gas law which is PV = nRT. For a constant 
temperature process, the pressure change and volume change would become exactly inversely
proportional. However, this is not the case for a real gas, although the relation becomes similar to ideal gas law
we cannot say if pressures decreases to its half value then volume becomes twice as its initial value.
The reason is that while in an ideal gas we assume zero interaction between gas molecules and negligible particle volume
compared to the volume that overall gas cover, those assumptions cannot be made for a real gas. To describe the behaviour of real 
gas compared to an ideal gas we can assume a hypothetical ideal gas that the same temperature and molar Gibbs Free Energy. By doing
that, in a way we have corrected our mechanical pressure that exerts on a real gas, with a chemically equal pressure value for an ideal gas.
This equal pressure value for a hypothetical ideal gas can be identified as the fugacity (f) of a real gas. By dividing this value with the
pressure that is exerted, a dimensionless fugacity coefficient Ï† can be obtained.


In this file we have some experimental values that measured for different temperature and pressure values. By using them, and using trapezoidal rule
I have calculated the fugacity of a given gas for different temperature values.

The column names are the temperature values in celcius degrees, and in rows pressure values can be seen in atm. Finally we saw that when we increase 
the temperature the fugacity coefficient is approaching 1 which is normal because we know that in higher temperature values and lower pressure values 
a real gas approaches to ideal behaviour.
