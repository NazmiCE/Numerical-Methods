Implementation of HardyCross Method with Python. 

The goal here is making a template of HardyCross Method 
to check the problem related with this method. Although 
we need to assume some values first and create loops on our
own, it would be beneficial for me. 

The next goal would be optimizing the code in terms of
time and space complexity. Since I need to write the code
faster I could not make any prior plan to reduce for loops.
One principle could be instead using discharge rates in loops
we can assign this property to members. When we change a members property
from a loop, all of loops that uses the same member can be updated simultaneously. 
The most difficult feature would be keeping the track of flow direction for a member
in different loops.
